            ~~~About C.H.I.P.~~~

Chip is an imaginary friend bot. Is your discord dying, no one on 
anymore? Don't worry Chip is here. Chip is a discord chat bot with
voice and text functionality. By using openai Chip is able to have 
a customizable personality in which is used to create a text response 
to you. Uberduck allows this response to then be turned into a .wav
audio file by using their text-to-speech. This file is then played 
in a voice chat. Lastly, by using openai's whisper api Chip is able to
listen to what you are saying in a voice chat and respond back to you.
