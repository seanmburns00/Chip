# About Chip
Chip is an imaginary friend bot. Is your discord dying, no one on 
anymore? Don't worry Chip is here. Chip is a discord chat bot with
voice and text functionality. By using openai Chip is able to have 
a customizable personality in which is used to create a text response 
to you. Uberduck allows this response to then be turned into a .wav
audio file by using their text-to-speech. This file is then played 
in a voice chat. Lastly, by using openai's whisper api Chip is able to
listen to what you are saying in a voice chat and respond back to you.

Chip doesn't use discord's slash commands because I felt it makes 
the interaction feel more real than with a normal discord bot. 
However, I made both the prefix and the command case insensitive 
for a better mobile experience. 

# What led me to make this. 
I've been wanting to learn openai's API as well as practice more python. 
I thought about this project and thought it would be a great project to 
work on the skills I wanted to as well as learn a lot of other stuff. 

# Skills learned/grown
Python
py-cord 
openai API
openai's whisper API
Uberduck API
FFMPEG

# What is next? 
I will continue to add any features I think would be great additions to
the project. One of these includes a conversation command. This command
would randomly choose to listen to someone connected to the same voice 
chat as Chip and would then have him respond. 

I also would like to work on a Unity Pakage utilizing these skills to
make NPC interactions a lot more interesting.
